# JavaScript Assignments README

This repository contains JavaScript solutions for two assignments: Assignment 1 and Assignment 2. Please refer to the instructions and tips provided below for a better understanding of each assignment.

## Assignment 1 - Fibonacci Sequence

### Task Description:
Using iteration, write a function `fibs` which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

### Example Input:
```javascript
fibs(8);
fibsRec(8)
```

### Expected Output:
```javascript
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]
```

### Assignment 2 - Merge Sort

### Task Description:
Build a function `mergeSort` that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

### Tips:
- Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same function!).
- It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you don't quite understand what should be going on.

## Solutions

The JavaScript solutions for Assignment 1 and Assignment 2 are provided in separate files within this repository.

- [Assignment 1 - `fibs.js`, `fibRec.js`](assignment1/fibs.js)
- [Assignment 2 - `MergeSort.js`](assignment2/mergeSort.js)

You can find the code for each assignment in their respective files. Each file includes comments to explain the code and its logic.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-assignments.git
   ```

2. Open the assignment files in your preferred code editor and review the solutions.

3. To use the functions, you can import them into your own JavaScript code and call them as needed.
